# DFMA Map Compressor

A home for any new code to create a cross-platform map compression tool.

Note, that Shadow Lord's map compressor can be found and maintained here:
- https://github.com/Ramblurr/df-map-compressor

This project, if anything, is about possibly building a modern alternative... but may not be necessary given the utility of the original compressor. Perhaps I intended that the tool have a home here along side the archive.
